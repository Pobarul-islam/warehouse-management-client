                        <p>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to divide security data among two gatherings â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a bunch of cases. JWTs are marked utilizing a cryptographic calculation to guarantee that the cases can't be modified after the token is given.</p>

                        <p>A JWT is a Base64URL encoded string, split into three areas, delimited by periods. <br /> <br />

                            Area one is the header. This segment contains JWT metadata; commonly data about the kind of token and the calculation used to sign it. It is encoded JSON.
                            Area two is the payload. This is the substance of the token and is additionally encoded JSON.
                            Area three is the mark. This is the SHA256 (or some other HMAC) hash of the encoded header, encoded payload, and confidential. This piece of the JWT is utilized to check the respectability of the message.</p>
